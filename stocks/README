This is a copy of Eric Laeuffer's stock quote library which has
been updated to deal with stocks outside the US. The library
hadn't been updated for a long time and was incompatible with
Yahoo's current way of presenting the data. This caused problems
for Siag's stock and currency functions, which relied on this library.

Since the library is now included with Siag Office, the option
--with-stocks has been removed from the configuration, and the
library is always built.

Original README follows.

To access US quotes just use the stocks symbol to grep or with the .US 
extension (RHAT=Red Hat Inc)
and to acces european stocks use the stock symbol with the country extension 
(13000.PA=Alcatel Paris)
(use yahoo symbol lookup to find stocks symbol)

All symbols have to be separated by "+" caracter.

As exemple some symbols

USA : BOBJ.US, ENT.US
CANADA: BMO.TO, IN.M, COT.V
AUSTRALIA: BII.AX, BKL.AX
MEXICO: TELMEXL.MX, TELECOMA1.MX, GFBO.MX
BRASIL: ACES4.SA, TLPP4.SA, FNOR11.SA

Here my test command:
libstocks_client "BMO.TO+IN.M+COT.V+BOBJ.US+ENT.US+BII.AX+TELMEXL.MX+ACES4.SA
+PCH.BA+MPA.CR+END.SN+LAB.SN+STA.OL+ISS.CO+508900.F+901599.FX+PLV.MI+TEF.MC
+VIKT.ST+VOD.L+13000.PA"

To get historical quotes :

> libstocks_client BOBJ 2000/01/01 2000/08/01

(the date format is YY/MM/DD)
