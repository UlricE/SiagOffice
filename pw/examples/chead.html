	The proper procedure when installing empty wumpuses is to first remove the
empty frame, so as to not leave room for another batch to develop. This can easiest be
accomplished by rephrasing every question, then directing them to a forum where they
can more appropriately be answered. Here is an example:

	"How many roads must a man walk down?"
<P>

	"Approximately five, depending on the time of the year."

I must admit that I have a crush on Courier Bold for headers.
