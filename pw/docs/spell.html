<h1>Spelling Checking</h1>
</center>
PW has powerful spelling checking, using <i>ispell</i> to do the
actual checking. To check the spelling of an entire buffer,
select Edit - Spell from the menu. PW will then start ispell
and send every word to it for checking.
<p>
Words that are not in the dictionary will be handed by a separate
dialog, which has the original word and a text field where a
replacement word can be entered. It is possible that there
is already a word in the replacement field, suggested by ispell.
Be careful to check that the word is correct; not all suggestions
are very helpful.
<p>
Under the text fields are several buttons.
<ul>
<li><b>Replace</b> the word in the buffer with the one in the
	replacement field.
<li><b>Accept</b> the word and do not ask again during this session.
<li><b>Insert</b> the word permanently into ispell's dictionary.
<li><b>Skip</b> the word this once without replacing it.
<li><b>Cancel</b> the whole session and do not complete the
	checking of the rest of the buffer.
<li><b>Help</b> brings up the on-line help page (this one!)
</ul>

If ispell is not available but aspell is, aspell can be used as
a replacement by symlinking like this:
<pre>
ln -s `which aspell` /usr/local/bin/ispell
</pre>
