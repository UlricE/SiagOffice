<h1>Credits</h1>

Credit where credit is due: major parts of this program were written by
people other than myself. There is no reason to re-implement
stuff that is already freely available.
<p>
For copyright information and installation instructions, see the
various packages. The sources
are hacked by Yours Truly to give the programs a uniform look.
If you don't approve of that and/or already have the programs
installed, there is no need to install my versions.
<strong>
These are not the original versions! If my modifications break
anything, complain to me about it, not the original authors.
If the original versions work and mine don't, then don't use mine.
