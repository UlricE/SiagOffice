<h1>Using the Online Help in Siag Office</h1>

The online help is accessed through any HTML browser by clicking
on the "i" button on the toolbar or by selecting from the items
on the Help menu.
<p>
The environment variable SIAGHELP can be set to the name of the
preferred browser. It defaults to a
<a href="siaghelp">wrapper</a> which starts
Netscape with the help document loaded, but any HTML browser
will do. SIAGHELP can be changed from the command line before
starting Siag, or in ~/.profile to make the change permanent.
<p>
Note that Netscape can't be used without the wrapper, as it behaves
differently depending on whether an instance of Netscape is
already running.

<pre>

# Example using Chimera
SIAGHELP="chimera"
export SIAGHELP

# Another example using Lynx in an xterm
SIAGHELP="xterm -e lynx"
export SIAGHELP

# This won't work properly
SIAGHELP="netscape"
export SIAGHELP

</pre>

(Chimera is a browser written by John Kilburg. Chimera
uses the Athena widget set; for this version I have used the 
Athena 3D widgets, giving it a more modern look.)
