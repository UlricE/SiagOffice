<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
       The gvu program provides an X11  user  interface  for  the
       ghostscript  interpreter.  gvu and ghostscript function as
       two cooperating programs.  gvu creates the viewing  window
       and ghostscript draws in it.
<p>
       Don't be alarmed by the number of options.  Generally, one
       invokes gvu with just one parameter, the name of the  file
       to  be previewed.  If the filename is ``-'', gvu will read
       from ``stdin''.  The  options  provide  a  way  to  set  X
       resources from the command line for a single invocation of
       gvu.  For  that  reason,  discussion  of  the  options  is
       delayed until after the X resources are discussed.

<h2>MAIN WINDOW</h2>
       The main viewport is on the right side of the main window.
       If the page is larger than the  viewport,  there  will  be
       scroll  bars along the bottom and right edges of the view-
       port.  To the left of the viewport is the  table  of  con-
       tents.   If  the  PostScript file has document structuring
       convention (DSC) comments, the table of context will  dis-
       play  the page labels (i.e. usually page numbers).  To the
       left of the table of contents is the menu box.  Each  push
       button  brings  up  a  popup  menu.  Over the menu box and
       table of contents there are  three  optional  labels  that
       contain  the  title,  date,  and locator.  The title label
       contains the document title found in the DSC comments.  If
       no  title can be found, the filename is used in its place.
       The date label contains the document date found in the DSC
       comments.  If no date can be found, the last modified date
       of the file is used in its place.   Since  the  title  and
       date  labels may be clipped by the main viewport, the date
       and title labels are push buttons that bring  up  a  popup
       window  with  the title or date.  These popup windows also
       show the ``document'' icon when the displayed string comes
       from  the DSC comments.  The locator shows the location of
       the cursor in the viewport.  The location is expressed  in
       the default user coordinate system.  The locator is useful
       for measuring bounding boxes.
<p>
       Within the main viewport the mouse cursor is a  ``target''
       when  ghostscript  is doing work.  The cursor is a ``cross
       hair'' when ghostscript is idle.  When moving  to  another
       page  in  a  document,  it  is  generally best to wait for
       ghostscript  to  become  idle.   Otherwise,  the   current
       ghostscript  process  must  be  killed and the overhead of
       reading the prologue is incurred again.
<p>
       Gvu will check to see if the file has been  modified  just
       before  it  displays  a  page  or  when the application is
       deiconified.  If the file has changed, it will reopen  the
       file.
<p>
       Clicking  anywhere  within  the viewport will popup a zoom
       window.  The window is centered about  the  location  that
       was clicked.  Clicking with the first mouse button pops up
       a low resolution zoom window.  Clicking  with  the  second
       mouse  button  pops  up  a  medium resolution zoom window.
       Clicking with the third mouse button pops up a high  reso-
       lution  zoom  window.   The cursor in the zoom window will
       display a ``target'' or ``cross hair''  depending  on  the
       state of ghostscript.  The locator reports the position of
       the cursor in the zoom windows as well as the  main  view-
       port.
<p>
       In the table of contents, the first and third mouse button
       function exactly as they do in a Text widget.  That is the
       first mouse button selects text and the third mouse button
       extends selections.  However, clicking  on  a  page  label
       with  the  second  mouse button will cause that page to be
       shown.  The page being displayed is marked with a  '<'  in
       the right margin of the table of contents.

<h2>POPUP WINDOWS</h2>
       There are several additional windows that may appear.  The
       copyright window will appear whenever  copyright  informa-
       tion  is  requested.  The information window appears when-
       ever the  ghostscript  process  writes  to  ``stdout''  or
       ``stderr''.   Whenever there is an error in the PostScript
       program, the stack trace will appear in this window.  When
       ghostscript  is invoked without the quiet option, informa-
       tional message regarding the  state  of  ghostscript  will
       appear  in  the  information  window.   The  copyright and
       information windows can be dismissed by pushing the ``Dis-
       miss'' button.
<p>
       The Select File dialog widget will appear when you wish to
       open or save a file.  The Select File dialog widget allows
       an  X11  user  to  select  a file by typing the path or by
       browsing in directory listings and selecting entries  with
       the mouse.
<p>
       All  the  usual  key
       bindings can be used in the text widget, except for Return
       and Control-M, which are equivalent  to  pressing  the  OK
       button.  The path can be scrolled using the large horizon-
       tal scroll bar, or by moving the insertion cursor  in  the
       text  widget.  The directory entries can be scrolled using
       the vertical scroll bars, or by  holding  a  mouse  button
       down  and  moving out of the listing.  The scrolling speed
       varies with the distance from the listing.
<p>
       The directory entries are terminated with special  charac-
       ters that show the type of entry, similar to the -F option
       of ls(1).
<p>
       The Select File dialog widget is in total control until is
       pops down.  No other controls in gvu will be active during
       this time.

<h2>MENUS</h2>
       There are five buttons in the  menu  box.   They  are  the
       File,  Page,  Magstep,  Orientation,  and  Media  buttons.
       There are keyboard accelerators  for  most  of  the  popup
       menus.   Be sure to read the keyboard accelerator section.

<dl>
       <dt>File      <dd>This popup menu controls file access:

                 <dt>Open...   <dd>Pops up  the  Select  File  window  in
                           preparation   to  open  a  file.   The
                           Select File widget is in total control
                           until  it  pops  down.  Opens the file
                           for viewing.

                 <dt>Reopen    <dd>Reopens the current file.

                 <dt>Print...  <dd>Pops up a dialog widget to ask for the
                           printer  name.   Sends the whole docu-
                           ment to the printer.

                 <dt>Print marked pages...
                           <dd>Pops up a dialog widget to ask for the
                           printer  name.  Sends the marked pages
                           to the printer.  If no pages have been
                           marked,  the  mark procedure is called
                           before printing and  then  the  unmark
                           procedure is called after printing.

                 <dt>Save marked pages...
                          <dd> Pops  up  the  Select  File  window in
                           preparation  to  save  a  file.    The
                           Select File widget is in total control
                           until it pops down.  Saves the  marked
                           pages  in  the  selected  file.  If no
                           pages  have  been  marked,  the   mark
                           procedure  is called before saving and
                           then the unmark  procedure  is  called
                           after saving.

                 <dt>Copyright...
                           <dd>Pops up the copyright window.

                 <dt>Quit      <dd>Causes gvu to exit.
</dl>

       <dt>Page      <dd>This popup menu controls page access:
<dl>
                 <dt>Next      <dd>Display the next page.

                 <dt>Redisplay <dd>Display the current page.

                 <dt>Previous  <dd>Display the previous page.

                 <dt>Center    <dd>Center the page in the viewport.

                 <dt>Mark      <dd>Mark the pages that have been selected
                           in the table of contents.  If no pages
                           have  been  selected, mark the current
                           page.

                 <dt>Unmark    <dd>Unmark  the  pages  that   have   been
                           selected in the table of contents.  If
                           no pages have  been  selected,  unmark
                           the current page.
</dl>
       <dt>Magstep   <dd>The  Magstep  menu controls the magnification at
                 which the document is viewed.  The default  mag-
                 step  of  0  implies  no magnification (i.e. the
                 size on the screen  should  match  the  size  on
                 paper).   Gvu borrows the notion of magstep from
                 TeX.   The  magnification  is  defined   to   be
                 1.2**magstep.   At  magstep  1,  the document is
                 magnified by 1.2.  At magstep -1,  the  document
                 is  reduced by 1.2.  The Magstep menu lists val-
                 ues from -5 to 5.

       <dt>Orientation
                 <dd>The Orientation menu controls the display orien-
                 tation.   A ``dot'' appears in front of the cur-
                 rent orientation.  The first mouse  button  sets
                 the  default  orientation.  The DSC comments may
                 specify an orientation of Portrait or  Landscape
                 that  overrides  the  default.   In this case, a
                 "document" appears in front of the current  ori-
                 entation.   The  second mouse button can be used
                 to ``force'' the orientation on  a  document  to
                 override the DSC comments.  If an orientation is
                 being forced, then a ``tie fighter'' will appear
                 in front of the current orientation.
<dl>
                 <dt>Portrait  <dd>Set  the orientation to Portrait. This
                           implies no rotation.  A portrait  ori-
                           entation  indicates  that  the longest
                           edge of the paper is parallel  to  the
                           vertical (y) axis.

                 <dt>Landscape <dd>Set   the  orientation  to  Landscape.
                           This implies a clockwise  rotation  of
                           the  paper by 90 degrees.  A landscape
                           orientation indicates that the longest
                           edge  of  the paper is parallel to the
                           horizontal (x) axis.

                 <dt>Upside-down
                           <dd>Set the orientation to Upside-Down.

                 <dt>Seascape  <dd>Set the orientation to Seascape.  This
                           implies a counterclockwise rotation of
                           the paper by 90 degrees.

                 <dt>Swap Landscape
                           <dd>Swap  the  meaning  of  Landscape  and
                           Seascape.  Most of the Landscape docu-
                           ments that I have encountered  require
                           a  90  clockwise rotation of the paper
                           to view.   However, there is no  stan-
                           dard  and  some  documents  need to be
                           rotated the other way.  The swap land-
                           scape  button  allows gvu to automati-
                           cally rotate the  document  the  right
                           way  in  response to the %%Orientation
                           comment in the PostScript file.
</dl>
       <dt>Media     <dd>The entries on  the  Media  menu  set  the  page
                 media.   Media defined in the document appear at
                 the beginning of the menu separated  by  a  line
                 from  the  standard media.  A ``dot'' appears in
                 front of the current  media.   The  first  mouse
                 button sets the default media.  The DSC comments
                 may specify the page media  that  overrides  the
                 default.   In this case, a "document" appears in
                 front of the current media.   The  second  mouse
                 button  can  be used to ``force'' the media on a
                 document to override the DSC comments.   Forcing
                 the  media  on  an EPSF figure will override the
                 Bounding Box.  This makes is easy to view a fig-
                 ure with an incorrect %%BoundingBox comment.  If
                 a media is being forced, then a ``tie  fighter''
                 will appear in front of the current media.
<p>
                 Here  are  the  standard  media  names and their
                 sizes.  The size  is  given  as  the  width  and
                 height in PostScript points.

<h2>KEYBOARD ACCELERATORS</h2>
       Most  of the popup menu commands have an equivalent action
       that can be invoked from the  keyboard.   The  popup  menu
       entry  must  be  sensitive  (i.e.  not grayed out) for the
       action to have effect.  Here is the default keyboard bind-
       ing:
<dl>
       <dt>Q         <dd>Bound  to GhostviewQuit() which is equivalent to
                 pushing the Quit menu button on the Gvu menu.

       <dt>O         <dd>Bound to GhostviewOpen() which is equivalent  to
                 pushing  the  Open...  menu  button  on the File
                 menu.

       <dt>R         <dd>Bound to GhostviewReopen() which  is  equivalent

                 the File menu.

       <dt>P         <dd>Bound to GhostviewPrintMarked() which is equiva-
                 lent  to  pushing the Print marked pages... menu
                 button on the File menu.

       <dt>Shift-P   <dd>Bound to GhostviewPrintWhole() which is  equiva-
                 lent  to pushing the Print... menu button on the
                 File menu.

       <dt>BackSpace, Delete, Prior, B
                 <dd>Bound to GhostviewPrevious() which is equivalent

                 menu.

       <dt>M         <dd>Bound  to GhostviewMark() which is equivalent to
                 pushing the Mark menu button on the Page menu.

       <dt>N      <dd>   Bound to GhostviewUnMark() which  is  equivalent
                 to  pushing  the  Unmark menu button on the Page

                 default is ``true''.

       <dt>horizonalMargin (class Margin)
       <dd>          Tells how many pixels  gvu  should  reserve  for
                 window  decorations in the horizontal direction.
                 The default value is ``20''.

       <dt>verticalMargin (class Margin)

       <dt>minimumMagstep (class Magstep)
       <dd>          Tells the  smallest  magstep  to  display.   The
                 default is ``-5''.

       <dt>maximumMagstep (class Magstep)
       <dd>          Tells  the  largest  magstep  to  display.   The
                 default is ``5''.

       <dt>magstep (class Magstep)
       <dd>          Sets the default magstep.  The default is ``0''.

       <dt>orientation (class Orientation)
       <dd>          Sets  the  default  orientation.  The default is
                 ``Portrait''.

       <dt>page (class Page)
       <dd>          Gives  the  initial  page  to   display.    This
                 resource  only  affects  the display of the file
                 listed on the  command  line.   The  default  is

                 environment  variable  is  set  to  the  desired
                 printer  and then this command is executed using
                 popen.  This command should read from  ``stdin''
                 and  send  the  file to the appropriate printer.
                 The default value is ``lpr'' for BSD and  ``lp''
                 for System V.

       <dt>printerVariable (class PrinterVariable)
       <dd>          Gives  the name of the printer environment vari-

       <dd>          Gives  the  printer name to use when the printer
                 environment variable is not  set.   The  default
                 value is NULL.

       <dt>printPrompt (class PrintPrompt)
       <dd>          Sets  the  prompt  used  to  ask for the printer
                 name.  The default value is  ``Printer Name: ''.

       <dt>printFail (class printFail)
       <dd>          Sets the string used to inform the user that the
                 printer  command   failed.    The   default   is
                 ``"lpr" command failed.''.

       <dt>openPrompt (class OpenPrompt)
       <dd>          Sets  the  prompt used to ask for a file name to
                 open.  The default value is ``Open File: ''.

       <dt>openFail (class OpenFail)
       <dd>          Sets the string used to inform the user that the
                 open    failed.     The    default    value   is
                 ``Cannot open file: ''.

       <dt>savePrompt (class SavePrompt)
       <dd>          Sets the prompt used to ask for a file  name  to
                 save.  The default value is ``Save File: ''.

       <dt>saveFail (class SaveFail)
       <dd>          Sets the string used to inform the user that the
                 save   failed.     The    default    value    is
                 ``Cannot save file: ''.

       <dt>openWindows (class OpenWindows)
       <dd>          OpenWindows  servers  sometimes cause error mes-
                 sages about bitmaps not being 1 bit deep.  Turn-
                 ing  on  this resource avoids the problem by not
                 using any bitmaps.  You lose  the  functionality
                 of  having  the current magstep, orientation and
                 media marked on the popup  menus.   The  default
                 value is ``false''.

       <dt>ncdwm (class Ncdwm)
       <dd>          The  Xt  Intrinsics  has a bug that causes bogus
                 information in the window  manager  size  hints.
                 Ncdwm  and  possibly  other  window managers get
                 confused by the bogus information and  make  the
                 window  extremely small.  Twm and mwm ignore the
                 bogus  information.   Turning  on  the  resource
                 avoids  the  problem  with ncdwm by doing things
                 slightly differently.  However, this can confuse
                 other  window managers such as mwm.  This bug is
                 fixed in X11R5 fix-10.  You should only set this
                 resource  if  you have the problem.  The default
                 value is ``false''.

<h2>GHOSTVIEW WIDGET RESOURCES</h2>
       Certain resources in the Gvu widget  may  be  set  by  the
       user.  These selected resources are presented below.
<dl>
       <dt>arguments <dd>(class Arguments)
                 Additional  arguments passed to the interpreter.
                 It is convenient  to  name  files  that  preload
                 fonts here for PostScript programs that continu-
                 ally reload fonts while rendering a  page.   The
                 default is no additional arguments.

       <dt>busyCursor (class Cursor)
       <dd>          The  cursor  shown when ghostscript is rendering
                 to the window.  The busy cursor is  set  to  the
                 ``target'' by the application defaults.

       <dt>cursor (class Cursor)
       <dd>          The  cursor shown when ghostscript is idle.  The
                 default cursor is the ``crosshair''.

       <dt>interpreter (class Interpreter)
       <dd>          The name of the executable to call to render the
                 PostScript.    It  is  convenient  to  set  this
                 resource to the path of an alternate version  of
                 ghostscript  for  testing.  The default value is
                 ``gs''.

       <dt>palette (class Palette)
       <dd>          Tells ghostscript how to  restrict  the  palette
                 used  when  rendering.   The possible values are
                 ``color'',  ``grayscale'',  and  ``monochrome''.
                 The default value is ``color''.

       <dt>quiet (class Quiet)
       <dd>          Tells  ghostscript  whether  to supress informa-
                 tional messages.  The default value is ``true''.

       <dt>safer (class Safer)
       <dd>          Tells  ghostscript  whether  to run in ``safer''
                 mode.  The default value is ``true''.

       <dt>useBackingPixmap (class UseBackingPixmap)
       <dd>          Tells whether to use a backing pixmap.  If  this
                 resource is false, backing store is requested on
                 the Gvu window.  Some  X  servers  have  limited
                 resources  for  large  pixmaps.   Also,  some  X
                 servers' backing store is much faster than using
                 a   backing   pixmap.   You  should  reset  this
                 resource if your X server is one of  the  server
                 types mentioned.  The default value is ``true''.

       <dt>xdpi (class Resolution)
       <dd>          Sets the X resolution of the window in dots  per
                 inch.   You  can use this resource to affect the
                 main window.  Zoom windows have their X dpi  set
                 explicitly in the program.  The default value is
                 calculated from the screen metrics.

       <dt>ydpi (class Resolution)
       <dd>          Sets the Y resolution of the window in dots  per
                 inch.   You  can use this resource to affect the
                 main window.  Zoom windows have their Y dpi  set
                 explicitly in the program.  The default value is
                 calculated from the screen metrics.

<h2>GHOSTVIEW WIDGET ACTIONS</h2>
<dl>
       <dt>notify(width height xdpi ydpi)
       <dd>          The notify event is used by the gvu  application
                 for  the locator and popup zoom windows.  If the
                 width and height are 0, the event  is  user  for
                 the  locator.   Otherwise,  it  triggers a popup
                 zoom window.  The default width and  height  are
                 72.   The  default  xdpi  and ydpi are 300.  The
                 height will default to the width if  the  height
                 is  omitted.   The xdpi will default to the xdpi
                 if the ydpi is omitted.

ENVIRONMENT
       LPDEST    The  LPDEST  environment  variable   gives   the
                 default printer destination on System V.

       PRINTER   The   PRINTER  environment  variable  gives  the
                 default printer destination on BSD.

LIMITATIONS
       If the document does not begin  with  ``%!PS-Adobe-'',  it
       does  not  claim  conformance  to the document structuring
       convention.  When these  documents  are  encountered,  the
       functionality  of gvu is limited to giving you scroll bars
       and a next page capability.  Because there is no table  of
       contents,  skipping  around the document and marking pages
       is impossible.

       If there is no table of contents  for  the  document,  the
       popup zoom window will always show the first page.

BUGS
       If   you   find  a  bug,  please  send  a  bug  report  to
       ulric@siag.nu.
