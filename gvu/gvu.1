.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIgvu\fP program provides an X11 user interface for
the \fIghostscript\fP interpreter.
\fIgvu\fP and \fIghostscript\fP function as two cooperating programs.
\fIgvu\fP creates the viewing window and \fIghostscript\fP draws in it.
.PP
Don't be alarmed by the number of options.
Generally, one invokes \fIgvu\fP with just one parameter, the name of
the file to be previewed.  If the filename is ``-'', \fIgvu\fP will read
from ``stdin''.
The options provide a way to set X resources from
the command line for a single invocation of \fIgvu\fP.  For that reason,
discussion of the options is delayed until after the X resources are discussed.
.SH MAIN WINDOW
The main viewport is on the right side of the main window.
If the page is larger than the viewport, there will be scroll bars along the
bottom and right edges of the viewport.
To the left of the viewport is the table of contents.
If the PostScript file has document structuring convention (DSC) comments,
the table of context will display the page labels (i.e. usually page numbers).
To the left of the table of contents is the menu box.
Each push button brings up a popup menu.
Over the menu box and table of contents there are three optional labels
that contain the title, date, and locator.
The title label contains the document title found in the DSC comments.
If no title can be found, the filename is used in its place.
The date label contains the document date found in the DSC comments.
If no date can be found, the last modified date of the file is
used in its place.
Since the title and date labels may be clipped by the main viewport,
the date and title labels are push buttons that bring up a popup window
with the title or date.
These popup windows also show the ``document'' icon when the displayed string
comes from the DSC comments.
The locator shows the location of the cursor in the viewport.
The location is expressed in the default user coordinate system.
The locator is useful for measuring bounding boxes.
.PP
Within the main viewport the mouse cursor is a ``target'' when
\fIghostscript\fP is doing work.
The cursor is a ``cross hair'' when \fIghostscript\fP is idle.
When moving to another page in a document, it is generally best to wait
for \fIghostscript\fP to become idle.  Otherwise, the current \fIghostscript\fP process
must be killed and the overhead of reading the prologue is incurred again.
.PP
\fIGvu\fP will check to see if the file has been modified just before
it displays a page or when the application is deiconified.
If the file has changed, it will reopen the file.
.PP
Clicking anywhere within the viewport will popup a zoom window.
The window is centered about the location that was clicked.
Clicking with the first mouse button pops up a low resolution zoom window.
Clicking with the second mouse button pops up a medium resolution zoom window.
Clicking with the third mouse button pops up a high resolution zoom window.
The cursor in the zoom window will display a ``target'' or ``cross hair''
depending on the state of \fIghostscript\fP.
The locator reports the position of the cursor in the zoom windows
as well as the main viewport.
.PP
In the table of contents, the first and third mouse button function exactly
as they do in a Text widget.
That is the first mouse button selects text and the third mouse button
extends selections.
However, clicking on a page label with the second mouse button will cause
that page to be shown.
The page being displayed is marked with a '<' in the right margin of
the table of contents.
.SH POPUP WINDOWS
There are several additional windows that may appear.
The \fIcopyright\fP window will appear whenever copyright information is
requested.
The \fIinformation\fP window appears whenever the \fIghostscript\fP process
writes to ``stdout'' or ``stderr''.
Whenever there is an error in the PostScript program, the stack trace will
appear in this window.
When \fIghostscript\fP is invoked without the quiet option, informational message
regarding the state of \fIghostscript\fP will appear in the \fIinformation\fP window.
The \fIcopyright\fP and \fIinformation\fP windows can be dismissed by pushing
the ``Dismiss'' button.
.PP
The \fISelect File\fP dialog widget will appear when you wish to open or save
a file.
The
.I Select File
dialog widget
allows an X11 user to select a file by typing the path or by browsing in
directory listings and selecting entries with the mouse.
.PP
The space bar can be pressed to complete filenames, and tilde is used for home
directories.
All the usual key bindings can be used in the text widget, except for Return
and Control\-M, which are equivalent to pressing the OK button.
The path can be scrolled using the large horizontal scroll bar, or by moving
the insertion cursor in the text widget.
The directory entries can be scrolled using the vertical scroll bars, or by
holding a mouse button down and moving out of the listing.
The scrolling speed varies with the distance from the listing.
.PP
The directory entries are terminated with special characters that show the
type of entry, similar to the
.I \-F
option of
.IR ls (1).
.PP
The
.I Select File
dialog widget is in total control until is pops down.
No other controls in \fIgvu\fP will be active during this time.
.SH MENUS
There are five buttons in the menu box.  They are the
\fBFile\fP, \fBPage\fP, \fBMagstep\fP, \fBOrientation\fP, and \fBMedia\fP
buttons.
There are keyboard accelerators for most of the popup menus.  Be sure
to read the keyboard accelerator section.
.IP \fBFile\fB 1i
This popup menu controls file access:
.RS 1i
.IP "\fBOpen...\fP" 1i
Pops up the Select File window in preparation to open a file.
The Select File widget is in total control until it pops down.
Opens the file for viewing.
.IP "\fBReopen\fP" 1i
Reopens the current file.
.IP "\fBPrint...\fP" 1i
Pops up a dialog widget to ask for the printer name.
Sends the whole document to the printer.
.IP "\fBPrint marked pages...\fP" 1i
Pops up a dialog widget to ask for the printer name.
Sends the marked pages to the printer.
If no pages have been marked, the mark procedure is called before
printing and then the unmark procedure is called after printing.
.IP "\fBSave marked pages...\fP" 1i
Pops up the Select File window in preparation to save a file.
The Select File widget is in total control until it pops down.
Saves the marked pages in the selected file.
If no pages have been marked, the mark procedure is called before
saving and then the unmark procedure is called after saving.
.IP "\fBCopyright...\fP" 1i
Pops up the \fIcopyright\fP window.
.IP "\fBQuit\fP" 1i
Causes \fIgvu\fP to exit.
.RS -1i
.IP \fBPage\fP 1i
This popup menu controls page access:
.RS 1i
.IP "\fBNext\fP" 1i
Display the next page.
.IP "\fBRedisplay\fP" 1i
Display the current page.
.IP "\fBPrevious\fP" 1i
Display the previous page.
.IP "\fBCenter\fP" 1i
Center the page in the viewport.
.IP "\fBMark\fP" 1i
Mark the pages that have been selected in the table of contents.
If no pages have been selected, mark the current page.
.IP "\fBUnmark\fP" 1i
Unmark the pages that have been selected in the table of contents.
If no pages have been selected, unmark the current page.
.RS -1i
.IP \fBMagstep\fP 1i
The Magstep menu controls the magnification at which the document is
viewed.
The default magstep of 0 implies no magnification (i.e. the size on
the screen should match the size on paper).
\fIGvu\fP borrows the notion of magstep from \*(Te\&.  The magnification
is defined to be 1.2**magstep.  At magstep 1, the document is magnified
by 1.2.  At magstep -1, the document is reduced by 1.2.
The Magstep menu lists values from -5 to 5.
.IP \fBOrientation\fP 1i
The Orientation menu controls the display orientation.
A ``dot'' appears in front of the current orientation.
The first mouse button sets the default orientation.
The DSC comments may specify an orientation of Portrait or Landscape that
overrides the default.
In this case, a "document" appears in front of the current orientation.
The second mouse button can be used to ``force'' the orientation on
a document to override the DSC comments.
If an orientation is being forced, then a ``tie fighter'' will appear in
front of the current orientation.
.RS 1i
.IP "\fBPortrait\fP" 1i
Set the orientation to Portrait. This implies no rotation.
A portrait orientation indicates that the longest edge of the paper
is parallel to the vertical (y) axis.
.IP "\fBLandscape\fP" 1i
Set the orientation to Landscape.  This implies a clockwise rotation of the
paper by 90 degrees.
A landscape orientation indicates that the longest edge of the paper
is parallel to the horizontal (x) axis.
.IP "\fBUpside\-down\fP" 1i
Set the orientation to Upside\-Down.
.IP "\fBSeascape\fP" 1i
Set the orientation to Seascape.  This implies a counterclockwise rotation
of the paper by 90 degrees.
.IP "\fBSwap Landscape\fP" 1i
Swap the meaning of Landscape and Seascape.  Most of the Landscape documents
that I have encountered require a 90 clockwise rotation of the paper to
view.   However, there is no standard and some documents need to be rotated
the other way.  The swap landscape button allows \fIgvu\fP to automatically
rotate the document the right way in response to the \fB%%Orientation\fP comment
in the PostScript file.
.RS -1i
.IP \fBMedia\fP 1i
The entries on the Media menu set the page media.
Media defined in the document appear at the beginning of the menu
separated by a line from the standard media.
A ``dot'' appears in front of the current media.
The first mouse button sets the default media.
The DSC comments may specify the page media that overrides the default.
In this case, a "document" appears in front of the current media.
The second mouse button can be used to ``force'' the media on
a document to override the DSC comments.
Forcing the media on an EPSF figure will override the Bounding Box.
This makes is easy to view a figure with an incorrect \fB%%BoundingBox\fP comment.
If a media is being forced, then a ``tie fighter'' will appear in
front of the current media.
.sp
Here are the standard media names and their sizes.
The size is given as the width and height in PostScript points.

1 bit deep.  Turning on this resource avoids the problem by not using any
bitmaps.  You lose the functionality of having the current magstep,
orientation and media marked on the popup menus.
The default value is ``false''.
.IP "\fBncdwm (\fPclass\fB Ncdwm)\fP" 1i
The Xt Intrinsics has a bug that causes bogus information in
the window manager size hints.  \fINcdwm\fP and possibly other window managers
get confused by the bogus information and make the window extremely small.
\fITwm\fP and \fImwm\fP ignore the bogus information.  Turning on the resource avoids
the problem with \fIncdwm\fP by doing things slightly differently.  However, this
can confuse other window managers such as \fImwm\fP.  This bug is fixed in X11R5
fix-10.
You should only set this resource if you have the problem.
The default value is ``false''.
.SH GHOSTVIEW WIDGET RESOURCES
Certain resources in the Gvu widget may be set by the user.
These selected resources are presented below.
.IP "\fBarguments (\fPclass\fB Arguments)\fP" 1i
Additional arguments passed to the interpreter.
It is convenient to name files that preload fonts here for PostScript programs
that continually reload fonts while rendering a page.
The default is no additional arguments.
.IP "\fBbusyCursor (\fPclass\fB Cursor)\fP" 1i
The cursor shown when \fIghostscript\fP is rendering to the window.
The busy cursor is set to the ``target'' by the application defaults.
.IP "\fBcursor (\fPclass\fB Cursor)\fP" 1i
The cursor shown when \fIghostscript\fP is idle.
The default cursor is the ``crosshair''.
.IP "\fBinterpreter (\fPclass\fB Interpreter)\fP" 1i
The name of the executable to call to render the PostScript.
It is convenient to set this resource to the path of an alternate
version of ghostscript for testing.
The default value is ``gs''.
.IP "\fBpalette (\fPclass\fB Palette)\fP" 1i
Tells \fIghostscript\fP how to restrict the palette used when rendering.
The possible values are ``color'', ``grayscale'', and ``monochrome''.
The default value is ``color''.
.IP "\fBquiet (\fPclass\fB Quiet)\fP" 1i
Tells \fIghostscript\fP whether to supress informational messages.
The default value is ``true''.
.IP "\fBsafer (\fPclass\fB Safer)\fP" 1i
Tells \fIghostscript\fP whether to run in ``safer'' mode.
The default value is ``true''.
.IP "\fBuseBackingPixmap (\fPclass\fB UseBackingPixmap)\fP" 1i
Tells whether to use a backing pixmap.  If this resource
is false, backing store is requested on the Gvu window.
Some X servers have limited resources for large pixmaps.
Also, some X servers' backing store is much faster
than using a backing pixmap.  You should reset this resource if your
X server is one of the server types mentioned.
The default value is ``true''.
.IP "\fBxdpi (\fPclass\fB Resolution)\fP" 1i
Sets the X resolution of the window in dots per inch.
You can use this resource to affect the main window.
Zoom windows have their X dpi set explicitly in the program.
The default value is calculated from the screen metrics.
.IP "\fBydpi (\fPclass\fB Resolution)\fP" 1i
Sets the Y resolution of the window in dots per inch.
You can use this resource to affect the main window.
Zoom windows have their Y dpi set explicitly in the program.
The default value is calculated from the screen metrics.
.SH GHOSTVIEW WIDGET ACTIONS
.IP "\fBnotify(width height xdpi ydpi)\fP" 1i
The notify event is used by the gvu application for the locator
and popup zoom windows.
If the width and height are 0, the event is user for the locator.
Otherwise, it triggers a popup zoom window.
The default width and height are 72.
The default xdpi and ydpi are 300.
The height will default to the width if the height is omitted.
The xdpi will default to the xdpi if the ydpi is omitted.

.SH LIMITATIONS
If the document does not begin with ``%!PS\-Adobe\-'', it does not
claim conformance to the document structuring convention.
When these documents are encountered, the functionality of \fIgvu\fP
is limited to giving you scroll bars and a next page capability.
Because there is no table of contents,
skipping around the document and marking pages is impossible.
.PP
If there is no table of contents for the document, the popup zoom
window will always show the first page.
.SH BUGS
If you find a bug, please send a bug report to ulric@siag.nu.
