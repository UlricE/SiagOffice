    Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript.

Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4 and later.

Brief list of features:
  - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring
    Conventions.
  - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring
    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.
  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.
  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or
    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our
    European friends.
  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.
  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring
    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.
  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,
    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).
  - Ability to restrict rendering to grayscale or monochrome.   (Requires
    ghostscript 2.6.1.)
  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that
    printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)
  - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution
    (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).

    The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people
    are encouraged to use in other programs.

    Ghostview-1.5 is available via anonymous ftp from:
	prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.5.tar.gz
	ftp.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/X/ghostview-1.5.tar.gz

Building ghostview:

    If you have xmkmf, type "xmkmf", and then "make".
    If not, manually edit the Makefile.

Feedback

    I welcome any feedback that you care to give.  Of course, I am interested
    in your success stories.  I will also try to help you if you have problems.
    However, I cannot make any promise of support.

    Please send all feedback to ghostview@cs.wisc.edu.  This is a spare time
    project and all the mail regarding ghostview must be directed to a
    separate mail box otherwise your mail may very well get lost in the cracks.

Frequently asked questions:

    1.  Why does half the functionality of ghostview seem to be missing?
	I cannot skip around in the document.  I cannot select pages to
	print.  There are no page numbers in the table of contents.

	The problem is that the document does not have the document
	structuring comments.  Without them, ghostview cannot tell where
	pages start and end.  Also, when reading from stdin there is no
	capability to skip around.

    2.  Whenever I ask ghostview to display a page, a separate ghostscript
	window pops up and disappears when ghostscript is done rendering
	the page.  How to I get ghostscript to write on the ghostview window?

	You must be running ghostscript 2.4 or later for ghostview to work
	properly.  You can pick up the current copy of ghostscript from
	the same place you got ghostview.

    3.  When I start ghostview, the information window pops up with:
	"Warning: Could not allocate backing pixmap in main window."
	What does this mean?

	Ghostscript draws into a backing pixmap and copies from the
	pixmap to the window.  Some X servers have limited resources for
	pixmaps.  Creating the backing pixmap failed.  Ghostview will then 
	request backing store on the window.  If the backing store request
	is not honored, obscured portions of the window will be lost.

	You might also request a smaller window by setting a smaller
	magstep or setting a smaller resolution.

    4.  When I start ghostview, sometimes I get this error:
	"Error: SmeBSB Object: Left Bitmap of entry  "0" is not one bit deep.."
	Other times it works.  What is going wrong?

	The only time this problem occurs is when an OpenWindows X server
	is the display.  It is likely a server problem.  I have placed a
	work around in ghostview that turns off all use of bitmaps.  The
	-openwindows option enables this work around.  However, with it
	enabled the current magstep, orientation, and media cannot be
	marked in the popup menus.

    5.  Sometimes ghostview produces an endless stream of this message:
	"Warning: Select failed; error code 9".

	Users have reported that this occurs on machines with a SYSV
	and BSD library.  The problem went away when they linked with the
	BSD library rather than the default SYSV library.

	This also occurs on some SPARCS running SunOS.  This does not happen
	for me and must be due to some differences in libraries or environment.
	I have placed a SPARC executable (compiled on SunOS 4.1 with X11R5pl10
	libraries statically linked in) on ftp.cs.wisc.edu for people
	in this situation.

    6.  When using ncdwm, sometimes the window shrinks to an extremely
	small size.

	Either use the -ncdwm option to work around the problem, or apply
	fix-10 to X11R5.

    7.  Ghostview pops up the information window with the message
	"Exec of gs failed".  It never displays anything in the main
	viewport.  What went wrong?

	Either ghostscript is not installed or it cannot be found in
	your PATH.  Please pick up the latest copy of ghostcript from
	the same place you got ghostview and install it.

Acknowledgements

    I really should put down the names of all the people who have given
    me suggestions and encouragement.  (But I don't want to hold up the
    release any longer. :-)

    I do want to thank a few people.

    - Karl Berry, for getting me into this mess :-) by soliciting for
      volunteers.
    - L. Peter Deutsch, for making ghostscript the good interpreter that
      it is and for working with me to include modifications in support of
      ghostview.
    - Erik M. van der Poel, for writing a good publicly available file
      selection widget that I was able incorporate into ghostview.
    - Terry Poot, for porting ghostview to VMS.

NOTE: PLEASE send all ghostview related mail to ghostview@cs.wisc.edu.

This is an adapted version for XawPlus on Linux or other system V release 4
based systems. On other systems you possibly have to change the makefile.
Ghostview now has a new file selection dialogue. I hope you enjoy it.
To Compile do the following steps:

1. make prog
2. change to user root
3. make install

If you want to build everything as root only type `make'.

And what do you know! Ulric took this classic and adapted its exterior
to the rest of Siag Office.

The main point of this port is not to get another version of Ghostview
with cosmetic differences, but to get a program which can display
embedded postscript images. Eventually a plugin will be developed
which enables Siag to treat EPS images like clipart, simple or more
complicated drawings that scale well. The Image plugin only knows
about bitmapped images, which do not scale well.
