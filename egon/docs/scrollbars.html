<h1>The Scrollbars</h1>
<b>The exact look and feel of the scrollbars depends on the widget set
that Egon Animator is linked with. In the following, I assume that the Xaw3d
widget set is used. Vanilla Athena widgets will also work fine,
but the behaviour is different.</b>
<p>
The scrollbars are used to move the grid one line or one page at a time.
Clicking on the small arrows moves the grid one line and clicking
somewhere else on the bar moves the grid one page. The grid can also
be scrolled by dragging the small handle.
<p>
No matter how the grid is moved, the point is always "protected" so
that it doesn't move outside the visible area.
