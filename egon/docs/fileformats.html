<h1>File Formats</h1>
</center>
Egon Animator has support for the following file formats:

<dl>
<dt><b>Egon Animator</b>
	<dd>The native Egon Animator format is simply a Scheme script
		which can be loaded to recreate the animation.
		As such, it is eminently human-readable and editable.
<dt><b>C source</b>
	<dd>The animation can also be saved as C source code. Only the
		data structures are saved, the code to display the
		animation resides in the files animator.h and
		animator.c. This makes it pretty easy to add animation
		capabilities to any X program. Egon Animator cannot
		load animations stored as C source.
<dt><b>Animated GIF</b>
	<dd>The animation can be saved as a multi-image GIF file, which
		when displayed in a WWW browser like Netscape performs
		the animation without using Egon Animator. Egon cannot
		load animated GIF files. Saving animated GIFs requires
		the netpbm package and the gifmerge program, neither
		of which is part of Siag Office but must be installed
		separately.
<dt><b>Postscript</b>
	<dd>Egon Animator can
		save Postscript images of the animation scene.
		Normally, this code goes straight
		to the printer or to Ghostview for previewing, but
		it can also be saved in a file.
<dt><b>Text</b>
	<dd>Plaintext files can be read and written.
<dt><b>HTML</b>
	<dd>Hypertext Markup Language can be read and written.
<dt><b>Magic Point</b>
	<dd>Presentations created for the Magic Point program
	can be read.
<dt><b>MS Powerpoint</b>
	<dd>Presentations created for MS Powerpoint can be read
	if the pptHtml program is available. pptHtml is part of
	xlHtml by Steve Grubb, linux_4ever@yahoo.com.
<dt><b>PDF</b>
	<dd>Egon can save in Adobe's "Portable Document Format".
	Requires the program ps2pdf.
