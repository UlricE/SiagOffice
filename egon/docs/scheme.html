<title>Egon Animator - Scheme</title>

<h1>Scheme</h1>

Egon Animator uses Scheme for commands. This means that the program
can be easily extended with new functions. When Load is chosen from the
File menu, for instance, the Lisp function (load-buffer) is called.
It is thus possible to make File - Load do something completely different
by writing a new load-buffer function, perhaps adding the ability to
read other file formats.

There are two ways to execute Scheme code:
<ol>
	<li>Pressing ( and typing it in the input window
	<li>Loading it from a file using 
		<b>(load </b><i>"filename"</i><b>)</b>
</ol>
A file can be loaded on startup by giving the option <b>-iFilename</b>
on the command line. A useful file to load is siod.scm which adds
common functions like caar, cadr and the like.
