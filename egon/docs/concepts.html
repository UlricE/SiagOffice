<dl>
<dt><b>cast</b>
	<dd>The cast is the list of objects that take part in an
	animation.
<dt><b>object</b>
	<dd>The available object types are Line, Rectangle, Arc,
	Ellipse, Pixmap, String, Point, Filled Rectangle, Filled
	Arc and Filled Ellipse.
<dt><b>script</b>
	<dd>Every object has a script, which is a list of ticks
	telling the object where it should move and when.
<dt><b>tick</b>
	<dd>A tick is a structure containing all properties of
	an object at a certain point in time.
<dt><b>property</b>
	<dd>The available properties are position (x and y), size
	(width and height), visibility, color, font and string.
<dt><b>duration</b>
	<dd>The number of milliseconds the animation will take.
<dt><b>delta</b>
	<dd>The number of milliseconds between each frame. A smaller
	delta can make the movement smoother but also present the CPU
	with a heavier load.
<dt><b>now</b>
	<dd>The "current time" in the animation. For every frame, the
	position and size of each object is calculated at the time now.
	If no tick matches now exactly in the object's script, the
	values are interpolated from the surrounding ticks.
