<h1>Introduction</h1>
Egon Animator is an X-based animation development tool for Unix. It uses
Scheme (a Lisp dialect) as an
extension language, which makes it easy to create new
functions (for native Lispers, that is).
It is copyrighted by
me, Ulric Eriksson, but is free for use by anybody
without paying me any money. Read the file 
<a href="../COPYING">COPYING</a> for
more information.
<p>
Egon Animator is part of the Siag Office package,
together with SIAG and PW.
