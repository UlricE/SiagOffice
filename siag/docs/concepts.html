<h1>Concepts</h1>

<dl>
<dt><b>label</b>
	<dd>A descriptive text in a cell that is not used for any
	calculations.
<dt><b>expression</b>
	<dd>A string in a cell which evaluates to a (floating point)
	numeric result. The
	simplest expression is a number; more complicated expressions
	can be entered in Scheme syntax.
	<p>
	The Scheme used in Siag has a few extensions to make it more
	useful in a spreadsheet. These new functions have been added:
	<ul>
		<li><b>(row)</b> Returns the row number of the
			cell which is being computed.
		<li><b>(col)</b> Returns the column number of
			the cell which is being computed.
		<li><b>(get-cell </b><i>row col</i><b>)</b> Returns
			the contents of the cell with the given
			coordinates.
		<li><b>(sum </b><i>start end</i><b>)</b> Returns the sum
			of all the cells in the rectangle between <i>start</i>
			and <i>end</i>.
	</ul>
<dt><b>grid</b>
	<dd>The area where labels and expressions are displayed.
<dt><b>colnum</b>
	<dd>The grey area where column numbers are displayed.
<dt><b>rownum</b>
	<dd>The grey area where row numbers are displayed.
<dt><b>mark</b>
	<dd>The "other" standard position in 
	the document, which is used
	for commands which need two coordinates.
<dt><b>point</b> or <b>current cell</b>
	<dd>The cell where labels and expressions 
	are entered. The current
	cell can be moved using arrow keys, the mouse and other
	methods.
<dt><b>block</b>
	<dd>The block is a rectangular area which 
	is displayed in inverse.
	It is used for commands which operate on a 
	whole range of cells.
