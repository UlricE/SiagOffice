How to make the function reference
----------------------------------

The function reference lives in the file siag-functions.html, which is
generated automatically from specially formatted comments in the program
source. This is done in two steps:

1. The program snarfdocs collects all the comments and creates one file
   for each function in a temporary directory.

2. The program snarfindex creates an index and copies all the temporary
   files into siag-functions.html.

Snarfdocs is written in C. Snarfindex is a Bourne shell script.

Here is the complete set of commands. Starting in this directory.

(make snarfdocs
rm -rf tmp
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
cat ../../*.c ../../*.scm | ../snarfdocs
../snarfindex > ../siag-functions.html)
(make snarfcmds
rm -rf tmp
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
cat ../../*.c ../../*.scm | ../snarfcmds
../cmdindex > ../siag-commands.html)

Generate keys.html:

../../siod/siod keys.scm

Generate commands.html:

../../siod/siod menus.scm
