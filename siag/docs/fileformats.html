<h1>File Formats</h1>
</center>
Siag has support for these file formats:

<dl>
<dt><b>Siag</b>
	<dd>Native Siag format, with support for Scheme and C-style
		expressions as well as formatting attributes (fonts,
		widths and so on). Very nice for Siag documents, but
		totally incompatible with anything else.
<dt><b>Comma Separated Values</b>
	<dd>Almost every spreadsheet can
		load and save this format, but all expressions are
		lost. Despite its name, any character can be used
		as field separator.
<dt><b>Plain Text</b>
	<dd>Every line is loaded as a label and placed in column 1
		of successive rows.
<dt><b>Lotus 1-2-3</b>
	<dd>Siag imports documents in Lotus Worksheet format and
		can save values in the same format.
<dt><b>Postscript</b>
	<dd>Siag can output pretty decent Postscript code, with
		DSC comments and all to make the resulting files
		post-processable. Normally, this code goes straight
		to the printer or to Ghostview for previewing, but
		it can also be saved in a file. Siag cannot load
		Postscript files.
<dt><b>HTML Tables</b>
	<dd>Hypertext Markup Language as featured on the World Wide Web.
		A spreadsheet maps nicely to the HTML table format,
		and Siag can save and load (well-behaved) documents
		in this format.
<dt><b>Scheme Code</b>
	<dd>Files containing Scheme code can be loaded and evaluated.
<dt><b>Troff Tables</b>
	<dd>Tables which can be processed by tbl to produce input
		to the troff document formatting system.
<dt><b>LaTeX Tables</b>
	<dd>Tables which can be included in documents using the
		LaTeX typesetting package.
<dt><b>Excel</b>
	<dd><i>Very</i> incomplete support for MS Excel (loading only).
		This requires the <i>xls2csv</i> utility which is not
		part of Siag.
		A better way to convert Excel files to Siag is to save them
		as Lotus worksheets (see below) in Excel and then load
		them in Siag.
<dt><b>PDF</b>
	<dd>Siag can save in Adobe's "Portable Document Format".
	Requires the program ps2pdf.
</dl>

<h2>Adding Format Handlers</h2>
Siag can use external converters to convert files from formats it
can't handle directly to ones it does handle. The converters are registered
by the function register-converters; see siag.scm for the default
implementation of that function.
