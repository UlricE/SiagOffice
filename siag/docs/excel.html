<h1>Notes for Excel Users</h1>

If you have previously used legacy applications such as Microsoft's
Excel spreadsheet, you already know most of what you need to get
started with Siag. However, <i>Siag is not an Excel emulator</i>,
and it is good to be aware of some of the differences.

<h2>Operators</h2>

In formulas, Excel uses ^ for exponentiation. Siag
has a syntax that is modeled after the C programming language. This
means among other things that ^ is used for bitwise xor. To get
exponentiation, use ** instead (this does not come from C).
<p>
<h3>Example</h3>
In Excel, 2^3 evaluates to 8. In Siag, you must use 2**3 to get the same
result, as 2^3 yields 1.
<p>
Another difference is that Siag has
<a href="c-expr.html">many more operators</a>.

<h2>Functions</h2>

Siag has hundreds of predefined functions. Many of those have Excel
equivalents, but not all. In the
<a href="siag-functions.html">function reference</a>, those functions
which are Excel compatible are marked as such.

<h2>Extension Language</h2>

Excel has Visual Basic. The primary extension language in Siag
is <a href="scheme.html">Scheme</a>, which allows you to define
new functions in a straightforward way - functions which can then
be used directly in your documents.
<p>
Siag can also use <a href="../common/interpreters.html">other
extension languages</a>.

<h2>File Formats</h2>

The best way to move files from Excel to Siag is this:
<ol>
<li>Load the file in Excel
<li>Save the file using Lotus 1-2-3 format (.wk1)
<li>Load the file in Siag
</ol>

If the procedure above is not possible (say, you have a file in .xls
format but no access to Excel), it is possible to load the file anyway
using <a href="fileformats.html">Siag's .xls support</a>. Be aware,
though, that doing this will preserve less information.
