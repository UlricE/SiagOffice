<h1>Introduction</h1>
Siag is an X-based spreadsheet for Unix. It uses
Scheme (a Lisp dialect) both for expressions and as an
extension language, which makes it easy to create new
functions (for native Lispers, that is). There is no requirement
to know Scheme to use Siag, expressions can be entered in
traditional spreadsheet syntax as well.
<p>
Siag stands for Siag Is Not An Excel Emulator. It is copyrighted by
me, Ulric Eriksson, but is free for use by anybody
without paying me any money. Read the file
