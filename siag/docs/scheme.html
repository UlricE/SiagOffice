<h1>Scheme</h1>

Siag uses Scheme for commands and expressions. This means that the program
can be easily extended with new functions. When Load is chosen from the
File menu, for instance, the Lisp function (load-buffer) is called.
It is thus possible to make File - Load do something completely different
by writing a new load-buffer function, perhaps adding the ability to
read other file formats.

</a>

<h2>Cell references</h2>
References to cells in the sheet can be done using A1 or R1C1 notation.
Note that this is a nonstandard extension to the Scheme language
which means that symbols cannot have names that start with one or
more letters and finishes with one or more digits.
<p>
When lines and columns are inserted or removed, the references
are automatically updated.
<p>
There is also a functional interface to the spreadsheet contents.
<dl>
<dt><b>(get-cell row column)</b>
	<dd>Returns the value of the cell.
<dt><b>(x-get-cell row column buffer)</b>
	<dd>Cross-references between buffers are possible by
	specifying the buffer name. The buffer must be loaded.
<dt><b>(get-string row column)</b>
	<dd>Returns the value of the cell in the form of a string,
	regardless of what's actually there: a string, a number,
	a label, an error or nothing.
<dt><b>(x-get-string row column buffer)</b>
	<dd>The same as get-string, but references another buffer.
<dt><b>(href n)</b>
	<dd>Refers to a cell n columns to the right (left for
	negative n) of the current cell.
<dt><b>(vref n)</b>
	<dd>Refers to a cell n rows below (above for
	negative cell) the current cell.
<dt><b>(area-sum r1 c1 r2 c2)</b>
	<dd>The sum of all cells from (r1,c1) to (r2,c2)
<dt><b>(area-min r1 c1 r2 c2)</b>
	<dd>The minimum of all cells from (r1,c1) to (r2,c2)
<dt><b>(area-max r1 c1 r2 c2)</b>
	<dd>The maximum of all cells from (r1,c1) to (r2,c2)
<dt><b>(area-avg r1 c1 r2 c2)</b>
	<dd>The average of all cells from (r1,c1) to (r2,c2)
</dl>
Additional functions can be defined in $SIAGHOME/siag/siag.scm,
where they will be available for all users, or in
$HOME/.siagrc, where they will be available for one user only.

<h3>Ranges</h3>

Certain functions can handle not only numbers and references, but whole
ranges of cells. Such ranges are written as, for example,
a1..c2 (A1 notation) or r1c1..r2c3 (R1C1 notation).
In this case,
the range consists of all cells from row 1, column 1 to row 2, column 3
(6 cells altogether). Not all fuctions can handle ranges.
<p>
Ranges update when lines and columns are inserted or deleted, just
like the references described above.

<h2>Functions</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>(backward-cell)</b>
	<dd>Move point one cell to the left.

</dl>

<h3>Functions available for expressions</h3>

Hundreds of string and/or numeric functions are available. The full
reference is <a href="siag-functions.html">here</a>. The reference
shows the standard syntax, not the Scheme syntax. The mapping
between the two is trivial.
<p>
There are three ways to execute Scheme code:
<ol>
	<li>Enter it as an expression in a cell
	<li>Press ( or Alt-X and type it in the input window
	<li>Load it from a file using 
		<b>(load </b><i>"filename"</i><b>)</b>
</ol>
A file can be loaded on startup by giving the option <b>-iFilename</b>
on the command line. A useful file to load is siod.scm which adds
common functions like caar, cadr and the like.
<p>
There is no difference between functions that are intended for commands
and those that are intended for expressions. It is quite possible to
enter the function (forward-cell) into a cell, making the point move
forward every time the sheet is recalculated (a command cannot be
entered directly as it returns nil and an expression must return
a number, but it can be entered as <b>(begin (forward-cell) 0)</b>,
which returns 0).
<p>
It is also possible
to make the program compute the sum (+ 1 2) every time a certain key
is pressed. Not very useful (except for debugging), but possible.
This is done by changing the keybindings in the resource file.

<h2>Examples</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>123.4</b>
	<dd>The constant 123.4
<dt><b>(- (+ 1 2) 3)</b>
	<dd>This evaluates to 0
<dt><b>(get-cell 3 4)</b>
	<dd>The contents of the cell in row 3, column 4
<dt><b>(get-cell R (- C 1))</b>
	<dd>The contents of the cell immediately to the left of the
		current cell
<dt><b>(href -1)</b>
	<dd>The same as above
<dt><b>(+ r2c3 r2c4)</b>
	<dd>The sum of the value in row 2, column 3 and the value
	in row 2, column 4
<dt><b>(+ c2 d2)</b>
	<dd>The same as above, except that A1 notation was used
	instead of R1C1.
<dt><b>(acos r3c1)</b>
	<dd>Arc cosine of the value in row 3, column 1.
<dt><b>(tan r2c2)</b>
	<dd>Tangent of r2c2.
<dt><b>(/ (sin r2c2) (cos r2c2))</b>
	<dd>Also tangent of r2c2.
<dt><b>(pow temp 0.25)</b>
	<dd>The variable temp raised to the power of 1/4.
<dt><b>(pow temp (/ 1 4))</b>
	<dd>The same as above.
<dt><b>(asin (sin 1.59))</b>
	<dd>This evaluates to 1.59
<dt><b>(r_sum r2c2..r5c6 r1c1 12)</b>
	<dd>The sum of all numbers between row 2, column 2 and row 5,
	column 6; the number in row 1, column 1; and the number 12.
</dl>

<h2>Command Reference</h2>

<h3><a name="load-buffer">(load-buffer)</a></h3>
Asks for a file name and opens the file with that name as a
Siag document.

<h3><a name="new-buffer">(new-buffer)</a></h3>
Opens a new empty Siag window.

<h3><a name="preview">(preview)</a></h3>
Preview the contents of the current buffer.

<h3><a name="print">(print)</a></h3>
Prints the current buffer using the <b>lpr</b> command.

<h3><a name="save-buffer">(save-buffer)</a></h3>
Saves the currently open document
using the most recently used filename. If no name has been
given to the document, the name "noname.siag" is used.

<h3><a name="save-buffer-as">(save-buffer-as)</a></h3>
Asks for a filename and saves the currently open document
using that filename.

<h3><a name="load-external">(load-external)</a></h3>
Calls an external program to load a document. This can be used to
load over a network, using a program like httpget. The program
must print the document on stdout.

<h3><a name="save-external">(save-external)</a></h3>
Calls an external program to save a document. The program must
read the document from stdin.

<ul>
<li>0: Removes borders from every cell in the block.
<li>1: Puts borders around the block.
<li>2: Puts borders around every cell in the block.
<li>3: Puts borders under the last line of the block.
</ul>

<h3><a name="set-cell-width">(set-cell-width)</a></h3>
Sets the width in pixels of the current column.

block where the database is to be, put the cursor on the line where
he wants to edit a record and select Data - Edit Record.

<h3><a name="data-entry">(data-entry)</a></h3>
This function is useful when entering data into many cells. After
a record has been edited, the program automatically moves down one
line and continues with the next.

<h3><a name="siag-net port">(siag-net port)</a></h3>
Starts a trivial TCP based data server which listens on port 8080
and understands the following commands:
<dl>
<dt><b>PUT r1 c1 r2 c2</b>

<dt><b>GET r1 c1 r2 c2</b>
	<dd>Prints one label per line from the range r1c1..r2c2.
<dt><b>QUIT</b>
	<dd>Exits the server and returns to Siag.

Remove all windows except the current one.

<h3><a name="other-window">(other-window)</a></h3>
Make the next window current.

<h3><a name="protect-cells">(protect-cells)</a></h3>

the left of it. Also makes those lines and columns stay on the
window so that they are visible even if the grid is scrolled.

<h3><a name="remove-protection">(remove-protection)</a></h3>
Removes the protection previously set by Window - Protect Cells.

<h3><a name="grid-lines">(grid-lines 1/0)</a></h3>
Toggles visibility of the grid lines on the screen. This does not
in any way affect the output when the sheet is printed.

<h3><a name="tooltip-set">(tooltip-set 0)</a></h3>
Removes the yellow popup bubbles when the mouse pointer is moved over
the toolbar buttons. See also the function (tooltip-set N).

<h3><a name="splot">(splot "lines")</a></h3>
Makes a surface plot using lines.

<h3><a name="plot-wizard">(plot-wizard)</a></h3>
Show a form where the user can specify the appearance of a plot.

<h3><a name="exec-siod">(exec-siod)</a></h3>
Enter a command to be executed by the SIOD interpreter.

<h3><a name="exec-c">(exec-c)</a></h3>
Enter a command to be executed by the C interpreter. This currently
is not operational.
