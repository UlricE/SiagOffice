This directory contains most of the plugins for Siag Office, small
applets that run inside a main application which also controls what
it does.

The plugins are:

dummy		Runs "normal" (non-plugin) X applications, allowing them
		to be used almost as if they were plugins.

hello		Displays a command button. Sends commands to main app.
image		Displays raster images
plot		Uses Gnuplot to produce graphs and displays them
text		Reads text files or runs shell commands
