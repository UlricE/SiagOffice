This is a prerelease of what will become Siag Office 3.4. Being a
prerelease, some of the functionality is not implemented, does not work
or is not properly documented. The purpose of this release is to give those
who wish a chance to try out the new version before it is officially
available.

Here is a list of things that are new from Siag Office 3.3. Some were
implemented towards the end of the 3.3.x development cycle; items marked
with a + are completely new.
